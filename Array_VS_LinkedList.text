Linked List vs Array

Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and this allows
a faster access to an element at a specific index. Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations,
hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element. 
This difference in the data storage scheme decides which data structure would be more suitable for a given situation.
