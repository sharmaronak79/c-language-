Which storage class should be used and when
To improve the speed of execution of the program and to carefully use the memory space occupied by the variables, following points should be kept in mind while using storage classes:

We should use static storage class only when we want the value of the variable to remain same every time we call it using different function calls.
We should use register storage class only for those variables that are used in our program very oftenly. CPU registers are limited and thus should be used carefully.
We should use external or global storage class only for those variables that are being used by almost all the functions in the program.
If we do not have the purpose of any of the above mentioned storage classes, then we should use the automatic storage class.
